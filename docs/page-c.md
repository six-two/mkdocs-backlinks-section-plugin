# Page C

> Yes, C can be a bit volatile and without careful attention, a bit racy at times. And certainly, it's got more than it's fair share of faults and it takes no exception to them. There's a reason most folks prefer to keep their heads above C level. Even with a few pointers, the language is only barely functional. All too often, you get a project and discover halfway through that it's "Some assembly required". The fact is, it can even be tough to enumerate it's flaws.

> But even though C has no friends, it's happy to link up with almost anyone. And you can always trust it when you call. And I know you say it has no class, but if you ask nicely you can con-struct some whenever you want, conventionally. C respects your privacy and won't get into your garbage, leaving you free to clean it up as you prefer.

> So the next time you think C is being rude, please consider that you may have just missed a reference.
